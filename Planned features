            Armor Types
Ranged       fighters overcome mages because their projectiles easily penetrate their robes. Ranged armour is usually crafted from tough animal hides, which is highly resistant to Magic attacks.
Melee        fighters overcome rangers because their weapons can cut through leather armour with ease. Melee armour is also effective at protecting against Ranged attacks, as their projectiles have difficulty piercing the thick, metal armour.
Magic        users overcome warriors because their spells conduct in their metal armour, effectively cooking them. Effective mages can also bind warriors while attacking from afar, and their magical robes resist Melee attacks.
