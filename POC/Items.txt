--- Tomes ---

  The Tome of Madness, while used for entering the PoC when thrown into the cauldron, could have a secondary effect.
  By right clicking it you could get a temporary new effect called "Insanity", which causes fake mobs, or hallucinations, to spawn, causing confusion. 
  Hallucinations will have a very, very faint hint of being translucent, allowing the player to see these fake mobs for what they are.

--- Armor Types ---

Ranged
  overcome mages because their projectiles easily penetrate their robes.
  Ranged armour is usually crafted from tough animal hides, which is highly resistant to Magic attacks.
Melee
  overcome rangers because their weapons can cut through leather armour with ease.
  Melee armour is also effective at protecting against Ranged attacks, as their projectiles have difficulty piercing the thick, metal armour.
Magic
  overcome warriors because their spells conduct in their metal armour, effectively cooking them.
  Effective mages can also bind warriors while attacking from afar, and their magical robes resist Melee attacks.
