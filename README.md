Extrapolated Dimensions
=======================

Extrapolated Dimensions is a Minestrappolation Addon that is too big to be included in it.
The Mod adds several dimensions to the game, each with unique items, blocks, loot and dungeons. The following dimensions
are scheduled for the Initial Release:

- **Aerius** - A sky dimension with plenty of new blocks, items, loot and boss fights.
- **Paradise of Chaos** - A parallel overworld dimension full of strange terrain features and monsters.
- **Virtious** - An hostile alien planet world with new enemies and tech.

## 1.9 Roadmap

The first version of Extrapolated Dimensions will be released for **Minecraft 1.9**. However, because it currently depends
on Clashsoft Lib, Brewing API and the Player Inventory API, these dependencies will be dropped and merged into this
repository.

The combined sources of these APIs will then make up the **ExtraCore API**. This library will be cut down to Extra
Dimensions's needs at first, but will be adapted for use with Minestrappolation later. Both mods will bundle it in their
release JAR files, but the ExtraCore API will also be available separately.
